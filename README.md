# LoanAproovalPrediction

In this session, we explore using multiple classification algorithms to predict if a customer should be approved a loan or not.

### Software, Tools, and prerequisits

1. Access to Google Colab or some Jupyter Notebook.
2. Basic python programing.

### Steps to completing the project

1. Import the necessary modules/ packages needed for this project.
2. Generate your dataset and clean them/ prepare them as necessary.
3. Split into training and test sets.
4. Encode and scale the data as needed.
5. Implement the the various Algorithms for this. For details on each classifer, visit the dedicated repo:
   - [Logistic regression](https://github.com/ccibeekeoc42/Basic_Logistic_Regression).
   - [K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/ccibeekeoc42/Basic_KNN).
   - Random Forest.
   - Naive Bayes.
   - Decision Tree.
6. Compare the accuracy of all 4 methods. In this case, Naive Bayes performed the best.
